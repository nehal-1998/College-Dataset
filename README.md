# College Dataset

# Introduction
In Lab 2, we analyze a College dataset and perform various functions to understand the variables. We will also be creating a new variable and provide visualizations.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is college1.csv. It contains information about various colleges including variables such as Private, Outstate, Top10perc, Top25perc, and Grad.Rate.

# Analysis
## Question 1: Create a new qualitative variable, called Elite by binning the Top10perc variable: divide the universities into two groups based on whether or not the proportion of students coming from the top 10% of their high school exceeds 50%. 
We created a new variable named Elite based on the proportion of students coming from the top 10% of their high school. The total number of Elite Schools is displayed.

## Question 2: Use the summary() function to see how many Elite universities there are. Use the plot() function to produce side-by-side boxplots of Outstate vs. Elite. 
Summary statistics of the Elite variable are provided, along with a side-by-side boxplot comparing Outstate with Elite.

## Question 3: Use the hist() function to produce histograms with variable number of bins for a few of the quantitative variables. 
Histograms are generated for three quantitative variables: Top10perc, Top25perc, and Grad.Rate, with different numbers of bins for comparison.

## Visualizations
Various visualizations are provided to aid in understanding the dataset. These include histograms and a boxplot.
